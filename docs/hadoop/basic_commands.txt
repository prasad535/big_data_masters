If issue with IP address
Solution:
VB -> file -> Host network manager -> new host manager and go to setting -> network -> adapter settings, then change newly created host manager.

28th Aug Live Class: 
LFS (Local file system): saving file in local.
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)

Question may mask from Cloudera admin side:
Cloudera Manager
What is total number of nodes used?
What was the configuration of the node?

Hue: UI interface to access each and every service and execute queries
-	Username: cloudera
-	Password: cloudera

To write queries:  Query -> Editor -> Hive
Instead of this, we can use CLI by just typing ‘hive’
To schedule: (OOZIE), Query -> Editor -> Schedule

We know also user Airflow external to schedule.

Let’s talk about CLI (Difference between LFS and DFS)
Ls – list out of the folders and files (not all of the files available in HDFS)

Hadoop fs -ls /           = to list all the files and folders in the Hadoop file directory 
Always append Hadoop fs before linux commands to execute Hadoop commands
Create test file in LFS:
Vi test.txt
Content: this is my local test file

If file is stored in the LFS, it cannot create replica. So, we need to store in the file in the Hadoop file system to create replica’s

Copy file from LFS to HDFS:
Hadoop fs -copyFromLocal test.txt /
Hadoop fs -copyFromLocal test.txt /tmp

To check file copied : Hadoop fs -ls /tmp

==== enter ipconfig to get ipaddress of the machine and enter in putty to get access of the system

Copy from HDFS to LFS:
Hadoop fs -copyToLocal /test.txt /

Hadoop fs -chmod 777 /test.txt

If name node is safe mode, you have to restart the services. 

Remember the version of the Hadoop version, in interview they may ask you? Command Hadoop version
History -> command to used to list down all the executed commands





Vi test2.txt 
Cat test2.txt

We can use put and get to copy and copy files from LFS to HDFS
Hadoop fs -put test2.txt /sudh
Hadoop fs -get /sudh/tet2.txt /sudh


Move file from HDFS to HDFS 
Hadoop fs -mv ‘source_file’ ‘destionation_path’

Sudo su  super user
Hdfs fsck /      = give health status
