Why Hive?
-	Simple to Use
-	Built on top of Hadoop.
1.	Framework/Wrapper provided to point to HDFS (logic will be converted into MapReduce code)
 

Hive Architecture
-	By default, Derby database (RDBMS) used to store the meta data information.
-	Limitation of Derby, If Hive is gone then Derby also gone. And it is not allowed to make more than one connection with Hive.
So, we can use external databases likes (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle etc., ) to store the meta data information. Below are the advantages.
-	More concurrent connections
-	Metadata backup
-	Expose to external use cases. (Automations to do some cleans or automated tasks to fulfill some tasks)
